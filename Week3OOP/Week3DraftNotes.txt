# Benefits of Java Dependency Injection
Some of the benefits of using Dependency Injection in Java are:

* Separation of Concerns
* Boilerplate Code reduction in application classes because all work to initialize dependencies is handled by the injector component
* Configurable components makes application easily extendable
* Unit testing is easy with mock objects
* Disadvantages of Java Dependency Injection

# Java Dependency injection has some disadvantages too:

*If overused, it can lead to maintenance issues because the effect of changes are known at runtime.
* Dependency injection in java hides the service class dependencies that can lead to runtime errors that would have been caught at compile time.

1. Lambda is just doing what an ANONYMOUS class is doing
2. use stream and any match when iterating through lists
3. use "enum" for classes that have definite choices or options (eg. male and female)
4. Static factory helps because you can name it and describe what its doing with their names.
    this improves readability.
5. Builder pattern allows you to create objects without the need for
    coding the constructor for the specific combination.
