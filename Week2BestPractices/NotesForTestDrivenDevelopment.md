# What is Test Driven Developement (TDD)

Test Driven Development is an approach to software development in which the unit test are written before the business logic.

1. Do not write any production code without a failing test first.
2. Write only enough test code as is  sufficient enough to fail.
3. Only implement minimal code that makes the failing test pass.

## Why used Test Driven Dvelopment (TDD)

1. *"It's testable even before any implementation is written"*
2. *"It promotes clean code and better code design"*
3. *"Less bugs"*
4. *"More documentation"*

## Early issues witb Adopting TDD

1. *"It can feel slow"*
2. *"It can feel unnecesary"*
