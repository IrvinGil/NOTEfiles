# Graduate Program Notes on Database (Web):

- The word **Persist** is the a word used to describe **Saving** data into a database.
- Video explaining ORM and Hibernate [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMR0ld5h938).
- When generating ID's and unique fields, the company practice is to use sequence table.
- **Scripts** and **SQL querries**  are written in *snake_case*.
- For `@JoinColumns` annotation: it will always focuse on the foriegn key as reference for creating column names.
- ***table_names** and **column_names** are set to singular by company practice.
- For every entity, the name of the ***sequence_process*** must be unique.
- Might want to consider using ***Views*** in the future for making templates on retrieving data from the database.
