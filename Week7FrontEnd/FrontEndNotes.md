# All About Typescript:
- Typescript is a language that is super set of javascript. Basically all valid typescript is also valid javascript.
- Advantages:
    - Strong typed: variable and object types are highliy specified.
    - Object-oriented features (pretty much just javascript).
    - Compile-time errors: Allows developers to know errors on compile-time unlike javascript that just shows errors on runtime.
    - 
- Difference between `var` and `let`:
    - `var` is made accessible to the nearest function, while:
    - `let` is only made accessible to scope of the codeblock where it is decalared.    

## Typescript Terminal commands:
- Viewing typescript version:
```
tsc --version
```
