# Questions to ask len on checking meeting:
1.  About the tests, on which directory should they be put? Because there are some function and variable declartion that are
instantantiated with protected access modifier or accessible only on package leve. Should they just be instantiated as public
in order for the test methods to access them? or is there should be a separate spec.file test in the package level of the 
service in order for the test file to access the objects?
