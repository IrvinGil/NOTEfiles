- REST means "REpresentational State Transfer".
- Web service connects and allow integration with existing web applications much like a library
- In a REST API request, a JSON is returned as the response from the server.
- Content type of restful web services:
    + JSON
    + XML
- content type in SOAP is strictly XML. If one thing is not properly defined, then the application would not run. (SOAP) Pretty much stricter than REST
- Compared to soap, rest is not strict and is more of a guideline. Rest has best practices.
- endpoint is a function that can be used by the consumer (of the API).


Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
- every source is identified by a unique identifier (URI).
- 
    + rest is very resource oriented. focused on object instead of action.
    + Best practice is to use nouns in Restful. 
        ```/profile/{profileId}``` instead of   ```/getProfile?id=1```
        ```/profile/{profileId}``` instead of ```/deactivateProfile```
        //ways to distinguish the command is through http methods (get, post, put, delete).

    + best practice is to use version:
        /api/v1/profile/{profileId}

- sample of resource URI's:
    + /api/v1/student/{student}
    + /api/v1/grade/{gradeId}   ||  /api/v1/student/{student}/grade/{gradeId}


- Filtering Collections:
    + Use Pagination:
        `/api/v1/student?page=1&max=10`
    + Use resource fields:
        `/api/v1/student?yearLevel=3`  (in this example, querry parameter is used to filter out the data being responded to the client)

- Common HTTP methods:
    + GET 
    + POST 
    + PUT (update; primarily used for updating resources)
    + DELETE


- "Resource means the objects being exposed"
- If you do a PUT request: you have to specify everythings else even though you just want to update one field.

- Idempotent - kung mangyayari sya, safe ba sya? or hindi ba ito makaka affect kahit ilang ulit ito ginagawa (invoked). 
    - Idempotent methods: GET, DELETE, PUT || Non-idempotent: POST

- Patch (more of like put) but different as in patch you only indicate the field that you will change. And also patch is considered not safe and somehow considered non-idempotent.
- HTTP Status Code:
    + 1XX - Informational
    + 2XX - Success
        * 200 - Ok
        * 201 - Created
        * 202 - Accepted
        * 204 - No Content
    + 3XX - Redirect
        * 301 - Moved Permanently
    + 4XX - Client Error
        * 400 - Bad Request 
        * 401 - Unauthorized
        * 403 - Forbidden
        * 404 - Not Found
        * 422 - Unprocessable Entity
    + 5XX - Server Error
        * 500 - Internal Server Error
