# What i learned as a newbie to the software development industry in terms of

## Applying for jobs:
1. "The job hunting field is a sea, it never runs out of fish"
    Don't feel like being left behind when applying for a job. There are plenty of job offer sites nowadays. Just stop overthinking, work on
    your resume, and prepare. Doing something is better than doing nothing.
2. "Don't bite more than you could chew"
    I would advice not to sugarcoat the effort applying for many jobs on a small span of time because it could be sometimes overwhelminig.
    The goal of the feat is to get hired, not to collecting job application experience. Just select the ones you are confortable with and
    focus. Don't excert effort on the ones you ain't gonna need.


## Interview Expectations:
1. "They are just asking you what you know, not on what you can do"
    You don't ask a 6 year old child whether he knows how to cook. You ask whether he/she can distinguish the tools and resource for cooking.
    Possesing advance knowledge is an advantage but in reality you have to start from scratch and learn things the way how your employer
    taught you. Just focus on being doing best in an interview.
2. "Always pace yourself with your interviewer"
    Just imagine an interview as having a tour with the pope. You pace yourself with their mood otherwise your actions will make your
    tour awkward. I still believe that "first impression lasts". Just try to be nice and have a good conversation.

## Job Salary:
1. "People always change for greener pastures"
    Sometimes you feel like you are undervalue because your friends have high paid jobs than yours. Jumping from one company to another is 
    not really suprising in the employment world. What's important is that you leave a good impression in whatever company you work on and 
    not just because you are after your salary.
2. "High pay equates to higher responsibility"
    In reality, high paid employees have 2x or 5x more responsibility and work than their subordinates. They don't just climb the status ladder,
    proved themselves to be there and they got the skills to show.

## Skills and Work experience:
1. "You will start at the same level as everyone else"
    Don't overthink much and just focus trying to learn and absorb all things taught to you. Remain observant and always know your workplace mood.
    Even if someone has work experience, but is also a newly hired same as you. You are still on the same boat. He can maybe row faster, 
    but you both are still on the same boat(level). 
2. "You don't treat your workmates like how you treat your classmates"
    Things are different in the softdev field. You must exert extra effort to understand his work and behavior because it might be reflected 
    to how he is doing his work. You could be working with your workmates for 5 years so it is important not to create misunderstandings and
    barrier with anyone of them.
