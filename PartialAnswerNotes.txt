#Have you ever thought about clean code? If yes, how 
and what practices do you use? If not, how do you now view
the code you've written and read in the past?

>> Yes, I have thought about clean code or perhaps some other 
ways or methods to make your code make sense and not just for your own reading comfort.Â 
During my third year in college, I started by naming my methods after what they were supposed to 
do and separating them from reserved programming words. Such examples are "RetrieveUserAccountNumbers" 
instead of "getUserAccountNumbers" because it might confuse the compiler from the reserved word for 
getters and setters. And as time passed and as I continued to apply such practice, I shared it with my 
groupmates during our thesis project so that it would promote the collaboration and readability of each 
other's codes and lessen the time needed to discuss each other's codes. Although my current coding skills 
are still far from making a decent "clean code," I am glad that I have applied some of the practices of 
clean code during my college time.
