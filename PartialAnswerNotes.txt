1. static factory methods vs conventional constructors
    a. what are the key advantages of using static factory methods over constructors.
    b. when can we say that need to use static factory methods?

2. what does immutable object means?
3.

2. On what projects/instance were you able to use this programming language?
>> During our thesis project, we used the C++ programming language to program the Arduino microcontroller of our prototype. My experience with 
The python was only with exercises related to our subject. And my experience with Java was when we were tasked to make a class schedule in
system as our final project for our software design course.

## DATA ANALYTICS
1. Tell me about a research or case study you have done that involves data analysis.
>> I never used any complicated data analysis methods, but we did use Microsoft Excel software to sort and analyze data during our thesis project.
We incorporated the use of Microsoft Excel to keep track of and analyze the electrical parameter readings of our test equipment to analyze the 
results of our study findings, such as getting the percentage error of our prototype data. During our case study, I also did data analysis when 
processing the results of the survey questions that were answered by the respondents.

2. What statistical tests and procedures did you use to analyze the data?
>> During our thesis project, we used the data readings from an industry standard multimeter as a reference to compare the data findings.
of our system prototype in order to determine whether the percentage error between the two is within an acceptable range.
We have run three trials for each of the five different appliances that we tested with our prototype system. We got the average data of the 
test trials and calculated the percentage error using a software tool to ease the data analysis process.

3. What statistical software did you use to run the statistical test?
>> We used Microsoft Excel software to help us with analyzing the data. We also used the same software tool to analyze the data of user 
rating with our system prototype to know whether the impact of the system is positive for the users or not.

## APP SUPPORT/SERVICE DESK
1. Tell me about a time when you had to troubleshoot a software or program?
>> When it comes to softwares that we have developed, we never had a real experience of troubleshooting. Because when a problem on
the software system arises or has been encountered, it is usually due to programmer error. But i do encountered some computer software
related problems such as my own pc slowing down.

2. What were the steps you did in troubleshooting?
>> There was this one time that my computer was really slow and late in responding to my mouse and keyboard clicks and also when opening 
software applications. So I opened Task Manager to take a look at what software processes were slowing down my computer. It turns out it was
a problem with 100% disk utilization. So I did some research on the internet and I followed a youtube video on how to solve it.
a "100% disk utilization problem". The steps that I took to troubleshoot the problem were
